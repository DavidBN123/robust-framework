**Hi developers,**

With engine update 5.1.0, we have been mainly working on fixing plugin bugs and internal optimizations.

### Improved Plugin

We've improved the roblox plugin and believe it is now our final revision. It was designed to no longer experience weird bugs and be even faster for your workflow than before.

### Optimized Framework

We've optimized the internal code of the framework to give you the fastest experience possible, while still maintaining our verbose APIs. We have also optimized `LogEvent` so now it doesn't take from your code even less.

### Rebrand

Canary has just been moved through a rebrand which we hope is permanent. The new logo design is appealing while still encapturing the organization itself, and has been also renamed to Canary Softworks as a primary alias. We did this to reach into more professional spaces and eyes.

### Separating Repos

We have been working hard recently to separate all of our projects into different repos. This makes it easier to maintain and allows us to properly take advantage of professional tooling. This makes testing easier on your end and also on ours.
