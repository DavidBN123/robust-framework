**Hi developers,**

With framework update 7.0.0, we have been working on a upgraded networking system and a better API naming scheme.

### New Networking System

Here we bring you another new networking system once again, completely rethought from the ground up. What it is doing is this time it is separating events and functions, no longer making specific controllers. This makes more sense for newer users and also has some performance gains.

### Rename Older API

We renamed a fair bit of the older API to make more sense with the latest standards. This includes renaming `Signal` to `Event` to have parity with our networking system.

### Docs Overhaul

We completely overhauled the docs fixing any issues with grammar or using older API examples. We also fixed up the changelog by updating links and fixing wrong information.

### New Automation Features

New automation scripts have been added to the Git repository, featuring automatically created releases and automatically published wally packages. This is now standard with the rest of our packages as well!
